#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration

This repository hosts my custom Emacs configuration.

* Intent
The basic goals of this configuration are the following:
- Modal editing: this is achieved with the [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] package;
- Fast startup: most packages in =init.el= are lazily loaded through [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]];
- Oriented towards C++, Python and LaTeX: with a variety of packages.

*Note*: these three goals are probably sub-optimally achieved here compared to larger, more involved projects like [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] or [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom-Emacs]]. I have used Spacemacs in the past, but wanted to make my own (relatively vanilla) configuration, and to keep it simple.

** Core packages
There are four core packages which define most of the UX with Emacs in this configuration:
- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is central to the configuration itself,
- [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] (et al.) defines the editing experience,
- [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used to define all shortcuts in a vim/leader fashion (similar to [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]]),
- [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] for auto-completion/fuzzy finding on anything.

These packages, with a couple of minor QOL packages ([[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] and [[https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/delight][delight]]), are the only packages unconditionally loaded at startup, making it rather fast.

** IDE Features for C++ and Python
I use [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] to interface with [[https://clangd.llvm.org/][clangd]] and [[https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server][python-language-server]]. Due to
performance concerns, LSP is not automatically loaded when a code file is
opened. The =SPC l= keystroke turns LSP on. In =prog-mode=, commands under =SPC
m= run LSP functions I use commonly.

Keystrokes in =SPC c= generally refer to compilation. In =c-base-mode=, the
=compile= function (=SPC c c=) is remapped to the =projectile-compile=, which is
build system aware.

** LaTeX
LaTeX support is done through [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]], with [[https://github.com/tom-tan/auctex-latexmk/][auctex-latexmk]] to interface with
[[https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html][latexmk]], and with [[https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html][reftex]] to manage references. LaTeX specific commands are under
=SPC m=, and =SPC c c= is remapped to AUCTeX's compile.

** Extras
=<f12>= cycles through dark/light themes, =<f8>= runs [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] on the current
project (with [[https://github.com/nlamirault/ripgrep.el][=projectile-ripgrep=]]). [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is used for git management, with
commands under =SPC g=. [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is there as well :wink:.

* Installation
Simply clone this git repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/prs513rosewood/dotemacs.git $HOME/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

*Disclaimer*: If you are going to use this configuration, I highly suggest going through the =Sane Defaults= part of the configuration and decide for yourself if some opinionated settings are good for you. Likewise, you should go over the keybindings. They should all be defined within their respective packages under the =:general= tag.

* Inspiration
This configuration was established with inspiration from:
- [[https://sam217pa.github.io/2016/09/02/how-to-build-your-own-spacemacs/][How to build your own Spacemacs]] by Samuel Barreto,
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6INMXmsCCC8][Spin your own Spacemacs-lite]] by Suyash Bire and [[https://github.com/suyashbire1/emacs.d][his config]].
